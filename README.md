# Sudoku Solver Program

The Sudoku Solver is a program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels using an efficient algorithm. It takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and fills in the missing numbers according to the rules of Sudoku, ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.

Key Features:

Algorithmic Solver: The program uses backtracking or other efficient algorithms to solve puzzles.

Varying Difficulty Levels: It can handle Sudoku puzzles ranging from easy to difficult.

Optional Graphical User Interface (GUI): A GUI can be implemented to allow users to input puzzles visually and interact with the solver in real-time.

User Interaction: Users can either input their own puzzles or generate random puzzles for the solver to tackle.

This project is perfect for Sudoku enthusiasts or developers looking to create an automated solution to solve complex puzzles. It's suitable for both personal use and educational purposes, where users can learn about algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
